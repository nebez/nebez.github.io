## Canadian-Iraqi software engineer & startup enthusiast based in Montr√©al, Canada

I've been developing software for nearly 15 years. Previously [SSENSE](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca), [LXRandCo](https://lxrco.com/), co-founder of [nukern](https://mailchi.mp/nukern/saying-goodbye-nukern-story-ends-here?e=4ee4706792), and now-defunct [Infantry Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_(video_game)).

Currently Principal Engineer at [Lightspeed](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/) building their presence, operations, and technology in physical and digital payments.

After two failed businesses and one successful [IPO](https://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=LXR) of an omnichannel retailer, I've developed a deep expertise in the ecommerce, fashion, and payments industries. I spend my free time helping start-ups with product development, technical direction, and growth through consulting agency [latitude85](mailto:develop@latitude85.com).
